Plantilla base del theme: http://simonpadbury.com/bst-bootstrap-3-starter-theme-wordpress/

* Repo en Github: https://github.com/SimonPadbury/bst

* Plantilla realizada por ENREDA SCA (www.enreda.coop) para IU El Puerto http://iuelpuerto.org/

#Licencia MIT http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT 


###Features

* MIT licence.
* Bootstrap 3 – CSS and JS enqueued. You can simply swap the default Bootstrap 3 files (included) for a custom made Bootstrap 3, and this theme will still work.
* Easily make this theme your own – if you rename bst.css to yourtheme.css, and bst.js to yourtheme.js, and then do a global search-replace to rename “bst” to “yourtheme” everywhere in the theme’s code, this theme will still work. (You must also modify the comments in style.css, and rename the root folder from bst/ to yourtheme/.)
* A starter CSS theme – bst.css, enqueued.
* Visual editor stylesheet – into which the same Bootsrap 3 and starter CSS theme are preloaded by @import, so that what you see in the visual editor is (mostly) the same as the front end.
* jQuery called from Google CDN, with a local fallback when offline.
* Modernizr.js, respond.js and html5shiv.css included – enqueued.
* Clean up scripts in place – for helping web design newbies find their way around the HTML outputted by WordPress. (Do not rely on these for security.)
* A few simple jQuery scripts – in bst.js, enqueued. Examples:

– The Bootstrap 3 offcanvas sidebar.

– "Hovernav" : the navbar has some modifications that make the dropdown menu appear on hover (jQuery plus css). The Bootstrap 3 js and css have not been changed, so you can easily delete the "hovernav" segments of bst.js and bst.css if you don't want them. 

* Custom comment list callback.
* Simple, intuitive, clean code.
* CSS, JS, functions and template parts in different folders.

This theme has been built for use as a starter theme and as a learning aid for people who wish to get into WordPress theme design.
